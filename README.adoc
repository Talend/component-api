= Component API

This module contains all the API component developers can rely on.

It must be used with `provided` scope.

= Developer note

IMPORTANT: Adding an API to this module must be followed by work in component-runtime
repository to ensure its support in web and Studio environments for a UI API and
standalone and big data (Apache Beam) environments for aruntime API.


Most of the API is based on meta-annotations, for instance UI annotations
are decorated with `@Ui` to be able to identify them and process them the same way.
